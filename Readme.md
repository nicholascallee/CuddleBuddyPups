# Cuddle Buddy Pups
## A website by Nick Allee

## Current Setup:
-  this project currently contains a finished book sales website. I am going to rework it for a dog sales website that takes inquiries only. No sales on this site.

### Plan of Action:
-  Start with laying out the pages that need added and removed. Scaffold those pages and ensure travel between them works correctly.
-  Determine if we want the user to be able to log in. what features would we offer that require that? checking the application status of an adoption?? maybe?
-  Work through each page and add detail as needed.
